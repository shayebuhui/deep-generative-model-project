## Deep-generative-model-project
Final project of deep-generative-model in Spring 2020

This is the code using tensorflow for reproducing part experimental results in paper [A Closer Look at the Optimization Landscapes of Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04848) and some other similar results. Two datasets: Mixture of Gaussian and MNIST are available. Four objective loss: NSGAN, LSGAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP are available.

We run this script under [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) 2.0 and the [TensorLayer](https://github.com/tensorlayer/tensorlayer) 2.0+. 

For any questions regarding the code please contact lindachao@pku.edu.cn.

### Prepare Data 

- 1. Generate Mixture of Gaussian (MoG) dataset:

```python
python data_gen.py
```
- 2. Download MNIST dataset.

### Run
- To run the code for the Mixture of Gaussian experiment:
```python
python gaussian/train.py --epochs 100000 --en_dim 1 --save_dir results --loss wgan
```

-To run the code for the MNIST experiment:
```python
python mnist/train.py --epochs 50 --en_dim 5 --save_dir results --loss nsgan
```

### Visualization
The visualization of the results can be done with `plot.py`, including plotting eigenvalue of jacobian matrix, eigenvalue of hessian matrix of generator or discriminator loss function, and distribution or visualization of generator samples. 

```python
python mnist/plot.py --task eig --loss nsgan
```
